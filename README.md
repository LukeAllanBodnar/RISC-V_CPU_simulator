# RISC-V_CPU_simulator
This was for my Hardware Architecture and System Orginaztion class. We were given a Minimalistic skeleton of the code and we had to fill out the rest. This program takes in the text of a file than shows what it would look like in memory of RISC-V 32 bit CPU. After that it changes the memory based on what RISC-V instructions within memory and prints it out again after all of it. There are options to choose what to show.
