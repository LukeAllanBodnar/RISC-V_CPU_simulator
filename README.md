# RISC-V_CPU_simulator
This was for my Hardware Architecture and System Orginaztion. We were given a Minimalistic skeleton of the code and we had to fill out the rest. This program takes in the text of a file than shows what it would look like in memory of RV32-I CPU. After that it types and modify the memory based on what instructions within memeory and prints it out again after all of it. There are options to choose what to show.
